# DJ-to-SpinRhythm
A program that lets you use your XBOX 360 DJ Hero Turntable For Spin Rhythm XD.
(PS3 Support currently being worked on!)

For the sensitivity, you can either edit the code (Hard for noobies)
Or edit your game sensitivity. Here's the reccomended sens:

Sensitivity (mouse): 270
Spin Wheel Sensitivity (fount in Mappings): 185

PLEASE NOTE: This is V1 with not easy customizability unless you know what you're doing..
(ill make it a gui for V2 with more things that can be changed and all that stuff)

Any errors please message ikonik2681. on Discord (include the period)

Enjoy and have a SpinRhythmic Time! (is that a word? idek...)
